# rime-hebrew-classical
Rime schema for transliteration of Classical Hebrew

This began as a fork of [biopolyhedron/rime-hebrew](https://github.com/biopolyhedron/rime-hebrew), but has gone very far that it might be appropriate enough to call this a new thing.

For keymap you can refer to [rime-semkey](https://github.com/mksinicus/rime-semkey) or have a look at the dictionary file yourself.
