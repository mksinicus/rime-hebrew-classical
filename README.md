# rime-hebrew-classical
Rime schema for transliteration of Classical Hebrew

This began as a fork of [biopolyhedron/rime-hebrew](https://github.com/biopolyhedron/rime-hebrew), but has gone very far that it might be appropriate enough to be declared a new thing.

## Keymap

For keymap you can refer to [rime-semkey](https://github.com/mksinicus/rime-semkey) or have a look at the dictionary file yourself.

Differences:

- For ệ (sǝḡōl with y-mater), `e^.`
- Use `=` for maqqēp̄ (though often transliterated as hyphen)

## Todo

- [ ] (Re-)Add Masorah accent marks
